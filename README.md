# Vishal Singh Rawat - Software Engineer

Hello,

I am Vishal Singh Rawat, currently a Software Engineer Consultant at Sony India Software Center. My work focuses on developing applications for Sony Group companies globally, ensuring seamless integration and optimal performance.

With a strong foundation in full-stack development, I work with technologies such as JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, React JS, TypeScript, Redux, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, and jQuery. Additionally, I have experience with tools like GitHub, Visual Studio Code, CodeSandbox, Repl.it, Postman, Figma, and Razorpay.

I am passionate about combining my graphic design skills with software development to create user-friendly websites and applications. I believe that good visuals not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also improve user experience and engagement.

When I'm not working,, I enjoy reading about personal finance, startups, and psychology. My side hobbies include listening to music and exploring graphic design. I also consume various forms of content, such as podcasts and videos, to broaden my perspective on different topics.
