            I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a unique combination of
            graphic design and software development skills. This unique
            combination allows me to deliver exceptional results in crafting
            user-friendly websites and applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In college at Government Engineering College, I started learning web
            development through external courses. As I went deeper, I saw how
            important visual appeal is for websites in a crowded online space.
            Good visuals don't just make a website look nice; they improve user
            experience and help reach the right audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            During college, I began freelancing as a graphic designer and web
            developer. This work sharpened my versatility and problem-solving
            skills. I believe in combining technical know-how with creative
            design to achieve great results in every project.
          </p>
          <p>
            To boost my technical skills, I joined NeogCamp, a full-stack
            development bootcamp, in my final year. There, I built projects and
            practiced extensively, gaining a deep understanding of technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduation, I joined Simplotel as a Software Engineer, where I
            led the development of websites for many hotels and resorts,
            enhancing their digital presence and client satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I work at Sony India Software Center as a Software Engineer
            focusing on developing applications for Sony Group companies
            globally.
